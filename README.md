# Image_Processing using Jupyter notebook and Python3
### Given a data set of images, conduct image recognition using Python3 and Jypyter notebook to determine if each individual image belongs to class (0,1,2,3,4,5).

# Prequisites
1. Jupyter Notebook.
2. Python3
3. Installing Anaconda (python3 version) will install 1. and 2.

# Getting started
1. Open Jupyter notebook and import an existing project.
2. Run the jupyter notebook files in the following order :
  1. group22_dividedata.ipynb - first you must devide the dataset( 50% for training, 25% for cross-validation, and 25% for testing)
  2. group22_train_logreg.ipynb - train the logistic regression classifier.
  3. group22_train_nn.ipynb - train the neural network classifier.
  4. group22_train_svm.ipynb - train the svm model.
  5. group22_test.ipynb - test the trained classifiers (logistic regression, neural network, and support vector machine)
  6. group22_demo.ipyn
